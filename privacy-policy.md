# Privacy Policy for Copy Link on Hover

**Copy Link on Hover** (the “Extension”) values your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle any information that might be collected when you use our Extension.

## Information We Collect

The Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal or identifiable information. We do not access or save:

- Health, financial, or authentication information  
- Personal communications like emails, messages, or calls  
- Your location or precise device information  
- Your web browsing history or activity logs

The Extension only temporarily accesses a link’s URL in your browser to allow copying that link’s address on hover. This data is not saved, shared, or transmitted at any time.

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect any information, we do not use your data for any purpose.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do **not** sell, share, or transfer your data to any third parties.
